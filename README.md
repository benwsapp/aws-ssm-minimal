`aws-ssm-minimal` is a purpose-built container image for running the AWS Systems Manager (SSM) agent as a sidecar in compute environments that do not ship with SSM pre-installed (for example, ECS Fargate tasks, EKS Pods, or plain OCI runtimes). The pattern matches AWSâ€™s own guidance for ECS Fargate based SSM sessions, and the image bundles:

* A lightweight TTL wrapper written in Go that supervises the agent, adds a configurable time-to-live, forwards signals, and performs activation clean-up when the container exits.
* A non-root build of the official [`aws/amazon-ssm-agent`](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ssm-agent) compiled directly in the Docker build.
* CA certificates (to interact with AWS APIs) and binaries only - the runtime attack surface extremely small (`FROM scratch`).
